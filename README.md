# SRNN
[Sliced Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN)](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1807/1807.02291.pdf).  <br />
SRNN is able to get much faster speed than standard RNN by slicing the sequences into many subsequences.  <br />
The code is written in keras, using tensorflow backend. We implement the SRNN(8,2) here, and Yelp 2013 dataset is used.  <br />
#My contributions: <br />
I update the code to adapt new API version as following: <br />
keras version: 2.2.4 <br />
tensorflow version: 2.0.0 <br />
python : 3.7 <br />
